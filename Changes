	  of run() for backticks.
	- General documentation improvements and clarifications,

	  indicate that any exit value is acceptable from a process.

	- Updated diagnostics section in POD.
	- License changed to that of Perl 5.6.0, or any later version.
	- LICENSE file added to distribution.
	- Moved to Module::Install for build system.

	  (RT #34896)
	- Updated t/07_taint.t to not fail on systems that have
	  zero-length environment strings.
	- Updated taint checks to always run on 5.6.x, under
	  0.07 they would never run on older perls.

0.07  Sat Apr 12 11:57:28 AUSEST 2008
	- Changed tests to use SIGKILL rather than SIGINT to avoid
	  complications on systems where SIGINT is masked.
	- All dependencies now explicitly stated in Makefile.PL.
	- run() now explicitly checked for tainted arguments and
	  environment, and provides helpful diagnostics if found.
	- Removed mention of unimplemented capture() command in
	  documentation.

0.06  Thu Sep  6 18:09:50 AUSEST 2007
	- Warnings are no longer emitted on failed calls to system().

0.05  Mon Apr  9 16:22:22 AUSEST 2007
